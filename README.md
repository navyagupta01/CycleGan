# CycleGAN - Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation

CycleGAN is a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed for image-to-image translation tasks without paired examples. This repository implements the CycleGAN architecture to learn transformations between two different image domains (e.g., horses â†” zebras, summer â†” winter, etc.).

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Unpaired image translation between two domains
- âœ… Cycle-consistency loss for preserving image content
- âœ… Identity loss for better color preservation
- âœ… Custom dataset support
- âœ… Training and testing scripts included

## ðŸ§  Architecture

CycleGAN uses two sets of:
- **Generators**: `G: X â†’ Y`, `F: Y â†’ X`
- **Discriminators**: `D_X`, `D_Y`

### Loss Functions:
- **Adversarial Loss**: Make translated images indistinguishable from real images.
- **Cycle Consistency Loss**: Ensure `x â†’ y â†’ x â‰ˆ x` and `y â†’ x â†’ y â‰ˆ y`.
- **Identity Loss**: Helps in color preservation by penalizing unnecessary changes.

## ðŸ”§ Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/navyagupta01/CycleGan.git
cd CycleGan
